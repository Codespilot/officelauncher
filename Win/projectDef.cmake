# This is an example of how to add a build step to sign the plugin DLL before
# the WiX installer builds.  The first filename (certificate.pfx) should be
# the path to your pfx file.  If it requires a passphrase, the passphrase
# should be located inside the second file. If you don't need a passphrase
# then set the second filename to "".  If you don't want signtool to timestamp
# your DLL then make the last parameter "".
#
# Note that this will not attempt to sign if the certificate isn't there --
# that's so that you can have development machines without the cert and it'll
# still work. Your cert should only be on the build machine and shouldn't be in
# source control!
